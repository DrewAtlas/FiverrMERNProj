# FiverrMERNProj
This project is part of a Fiverr.com project that I'm sourcing
I need an Expert in MERN stack deployment to write documentation that allows 
me to deploy my windows-developed project onto a Remote AWS-based Ubuntu box. 
This person will also port an existing demo app to such a box as a proof of concept. 

Base code for 2 node example apps that should be part of the MERN deliverable

See the PDF in the documentation folder for more details.
